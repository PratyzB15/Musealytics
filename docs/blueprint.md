# **App Name**: Musealytics

## Core Features:

- Video Feed Ingestion: Screen capture and feed division tool. Capture footage from multiple camera displays (or parallel feeds) and divide the screen into individual camera frames to feed into AI models.
- AI-Powered Visitor Analysis: Visitor Density and Dwell Time Analysis tool.  Utilize AI (YOLO, MediaPipe) to detect and track visitors, calculate density, and estimate dwell time at exhibits. Anonymize data to preserve visitor privacy.
- Interactive Heatmap Display: Real-time Gallery Layout UI. Display a real-time gallery layout with visitor density heatmaps overlaid. Visualize dwell times and engagement levels for different exhibits.
- Environmental Control Simulation: Simulated Environmental Response.  Simulate the triggering of environmental controls (lights, AC) based on visitor density thresholds. 
- Custom camera mapping: Gallery arrangement settings. Allow the user to manually set the location of each camera so that an aggregate view is displayed that matches the actual museum layout.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a muted teal (#4DB6AC) to create a calming and informative ambiance.
- Secondary color: Soft gray (#B0BEC5) for backgrounds and content containers, providing visual clarity.
- Accent: Use a warm amber (#FFB300) as the accent color, especially to highlight important data points or interactive elements within the interface.
- Clear, sans-serif fonts for all text elements to ensure readability and accessibility.
- Simple, consistent icons to represent different data points, gallery zones, and control actions.
- Clean and structured layout to ensure that information is easily digestible and does not overwhelm users.
